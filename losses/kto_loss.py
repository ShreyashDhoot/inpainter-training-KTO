    """KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) loss with KL-centering and preference weighting.
    
    Implements KTO loss that encourages the trainable model to outperform the
    reference model on safe/preferred samples (label=1) while matching or
    underperforming on unsafe/adversarial samples (label=0).
    
    Key improvements over simple preference learning:
    - KL-centering: normalizes preference signal relative to KL divergence from reference
    - Asymmetric label handling: different gradient directions for safe vs. unsafe samples
    - High-precision scaling: large beta value enables sharp preference signal
    
    Args:
        pred_train (torch.Tensor): Noise predictions from trainable UNet,
                                  shape (batch_size, 4, H, W).
        pred_ref (torch.Tensor): Noise predictions from reference UNet,
                                shape (batch_size, 4, H, W).
        noise (torch.Tensor): Original noise target, shape (batch_size, 4, H, W).
        label (torch.Tensor): Preference labels, shape (batch_size,).
                             1.0 for safe/preferred, 0.0 for unsafe/adversarial.
        mask_l (torch.Tensor): Inpainting mask in latent space,
                      shape (batch_size, 1, H, W).
        beta (float): Scaling factor for preference signal. Defaults to 1000.0.
                     Higher values create sharper preference gradients.
        mask_weight (float): Extra weight applied to masked regions. Defaults to 1.0.
    
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Scalar KTO loss value.
